This API is for the SAE 5 of the IUT of Lannion. 

In this project, we have to create a game that is based on a book which you are the hero. This book is called "La cit√© des voleurs".

This API will return some elements needed for the game, like each node of the book, the links between them, the actions, the foes, etc.
